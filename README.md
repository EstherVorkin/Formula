# Formula
Team Perception

Algo for object detecting:

- Git of the Zurich champion of 2018 - 
https://github.com/ankitdhall
Image Segmentation section is good
Using 2 Velodine lidar with ZED camera 360 degree

- AdaptNet - making semantic labeling - blurring an image and represening big common color spots
- Working with HSV instead of RGB - better color recognition - not only one color a time but a range of colors
- OpenCV ? - many useful eays for recognition of a similar object in a short time while moving

- YOLOv3 algo
- SSD500 - heavier yet better than YOLO

- RCNN- good for small objects - could be a helpful way for checking conus from a distance
